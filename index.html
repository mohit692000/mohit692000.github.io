            Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.[1] Owing to
            the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to
            animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent
            throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat
            has been variously adapted to regional tastes. Chicken can be
            prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling,
            barbecuing, frying, and boiling, among many others, depending on its
            purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken
            has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as
            being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of
            cholesterol and saturated fat.[2]The modern chicken is a descendant
            of red junglefowl hybrids along with the grey junglefowl first
            raised thousands of years ago in the northern parts of the Indian
            subcontinent.[4] Chicken as a meat has been depicted in Babylonian
            carvings from around 600 BC.[5] Chicken was one of the most common
            meats available in the Middle Ages.[6][7] For thousands of years, a
            number of different kinds of chicken have been eaten across most of
            the Eastern hemisphere,[8] including capons, pullets, and hens. It
            was one of the basic ingredients in blancmange, a stew usually
            consisting of chicken and fried onions cooked in milk and seasoned
            with spices and sugar.[9] In the United States in the 1800s, chicken
            was more expensive than other meats and it was "sought by the rich
            because [it is] so costly as to be an uncommon dish."[10] Chicken
            consumption in the U.S. increased during World War II due to a
            shortage of beef and pork.[11] In Europe, consumption of chicken
            overtook that of beef and veal in 1996, linked to consumer awareness
            of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease).[12]chickens
